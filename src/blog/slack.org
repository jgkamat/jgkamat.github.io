* Preface

Communication is a tricky problem, because it's hard to make everyone
happy. When internet messaging started out, we had lots of choices, due to the
existence of standards that allowed multiple servers to talk to each other ([[https://xmpp.org/][XMPP]]
federation) and standards that allowed a single client to talk to multiple
servers (IRC). In recent years, we have backtracked away from that model in
favor of hundreds of closed protocols, forcing users to install /[[https://xkcd.com/1810/][yet another
client]]/ for every service they use (hangouts, messenger, signal, telegram,
groupme, whatsapp, skype, tox, SMS, ...). This means that if you *love* a
particular chat app, you simply won't be able to use it everywhere!

** Slack

Slack is a particularly bad example of the above, since it's a tool 'targeted'
towards /team/ communication, rather than just direct messages. Usually, a team
consists of many more people than the average chat, and that makes the above
even more relevant, since the more people you need to connect, the more
flexibility you must have to keep the team happy and running smoothly. Slack
disallows features that even IRC has had for decades, such as ignoring,
blocking, message filtering, and knocking, which makes it a terrible tool for
any team that is actually trying to get things done. Unfortunately, I have been forced
into using slack in a few places that I 'work' at, which will hopefully no
longer be necessary in the long term.

However, Slack goes even further by also being terribly designed under the hood,
making it extremely easy to 'break'. While these are 'not security problems',
they do cause serious problems to team communication, and are impossible for
moderators to fix without slack admins intervening.

I do have code for most of these 'exploits', but I will not be linking to them
directly to make them 'harder to use'. They are /somewhere/ in my GitHub
namespace though. I have not done anything with a TODO on my own, but it
shouldn't be too hard.

*TL;DR:* This is a guide to making your fellow slack user's lives as painful as
 possible, ideally while staying anonymous.

* Message Limits

Message limits are the first core problem of slack. Since most slack users use a
web client, and don't store any messages locally, 'clearing' the message history
causes a bunch of problems.

Slack message limits are shared across dms, mpdms, public channels, and private
channels. Slack message limits include both human and bot messages.

** Message Bomb

Slack has very generous throttling rates, even for extended periods of
time. It's incredibly easy to make a bot that keeps posting something in a
private channel. Since bots and DM's count to the message limit, we can speed
this up even more by getting a bot to do half our work!

We can speed this up even more by exploiting other bot features, which I'll talk
about later.

The message limit is 10,000 messages. Assuming we're posting at a *very
conservative* one message per second, that lets us clear the message history in
about 3 hours. With slackbot replying to all of our messages as well, that comes
down to 1.5 hours. This is crazy for such a slow rate. At higher rates (or with
multiple accounts), we can clear the message history in a matter of minutes or
seconds, meaning that people won't be able to see any messages if they are more
than a couple minutes old.

Deleting messages DOES NOT FREE UP HISTORY, so deleted history is GONE
FOREVER. The only way to get a team's messages back is to pay slack support (or
have them stored locally).

*BONUS:* Since we're clearing messages so quickly, DM's or other notifications
that show up won't be able to be cleared with default settings in the ui. This
means people will be stuck with unread notification markers they won't be able
to clear without some extra effort!

* Slack Namespace

Unlike any other self respecting (modern) chat application, it is *impossible*
to create two channels with the same name. As if this isn't bad enough, this
namespace is *shared* among users, public channels, private channels, and user
groups.

It's impossible for moderators to see who's hoarding the channel namespace.

** Channel Hoarding

This is especially effective when joining a new slack team. Simply by creating
tons and tons of private channels with popular names such as ~leads~, ~dev~, and
~beta~, we can make logical channel unavailable for public. Even better, make
channels that conflict with /users/ and /user groups/ that could be made in the
future.

Private channels are also very useful, since they are needed for many of the
other 'exploits'. Private channel creation can be turned off by your
moderator. However, moderators are unable to delete /existing/ private slack
channels, so hoard private channels early!

** TODO Channel Creation Bot

It wouldn't be too hard to make a bot that creates private channels with every
possible name. It probably would be a good idea to start with a wordlist,
tailored to the team being targeted, to maximize the effect.

Another idea is to detect any username change from posts in #general (which you
cannot leave), and create a private channel with the old username. This would
prevent any user from re-using their old username.

* Lack of Permissions

A lot of issues come up when mixing some of the more restrictive permissions
options with 'unconventional' usage.

** TODO Channel Jail Bot

For example, a common (but not default) setting is to restrict archiving
channels. This means that when you create a private channel, you'll be unable to
delete or even leave it until someone else joins (who in-turn will be
jailed). The web UI does not make this clear at all though, and it confuses
everyone who is jailed for their first time.

It wouldn't be too hard to detect when someone says something you don't like,
create a private channel for them, add them to said channel, and leave said
channel. This is a huge annoyance for the recipient, since it clutters their
channel list and gives them an unneeded notification (which cannot be disabled
by any means in the slack app). If they attempt to jail the bot itself, the bot
could immediately leave the channel. Other than that, it guarantees that at
least one member will be jailed, until a moderator is added.

Unfortunately, it's easy to see who's doing this in the logs, but there's no way
an moderator can prevent this from happening besides banning private channels
(stock up while you can), or by disabling your account.

If you combine this with the Message bomb method above, we can quickly clear our
invite/part logs as well, which can hide your tracks to some extent.

* Notification Spam

Notification spam is unfortunately hard to achieve without getting noticed,
because notifications usually have the sender's name attached. There are ways to
get around this though\dots

Since no one can leave #general, (and most slack moderators don't change settings
about ~@everyone/@here/@channel~), it is extremely easy to send the entire team a
notification with a quick ~@channel/@everyone~. If you delete the post immediately
after that, the only thing linking you to the notification is direct
eyewitnesses or the notification popup itself.

* Bots
Bots let you take some of the burden off of your own infrastructure, and make
breaking slack easier than ever for everyone!
** PlusPlus

[[https://plusplus.chat/][PlusPlus]] is a very popular extension for slack, and is installed on many
teams. However, it's very easy to exploit PlusPlus for evil. Because PlusPlus is
installed on a team, rather than on a channel (like IRC), it's trivially easy to
exploit, [[https://plusplus.chat/things/leaderboard][as the leaderboards of plusplus show]].

First of all, we can trigger plusplus in a couple ways:

- ~@username++~
- ~username+++~
- ~@anything++~

I found that if one method of voting did not work in my automation, a different
one would work, so I was able to trigger plusplus from anywhere (that isn't a
'true slack bot', as slack bots cannot talk to each other).

PlusPlus replies like this:

- ~Woot! [@username++, now at # points]~
- ~Ouch! [@username--, now at # points]~

This means that in addition to the notification you get when someone initially
++'s you, you get another one when the bot replies (which can improve the
section above)!

You can pair this with ~@channel~ or ~@everyone~ to notify everyone on the team
twice. If your team has the ~username:~ style of notification turned off, you
can exploit this by sending a ~username+++~, which will /not/ trigger a
notification on your message, but /will/ trigger one in the reply.

A bot that posts a ~+++~ style of plussing, and immediately deletes it's post
will trigger a notification with no trace back to the bot, other than an
eyewitness testimony.

PlusPlus has the ability to add/subtract multiple people at once, like so:

- ~username+++ username2+++~

Even better, it sends an individual message for *every single one*.

It's incredibly easy to build a file full of ~@1-- @2-- @3--...~, post a single
message, and delete your initial post. Once a wave like this starts, it can go
on for a couple minutes before slack begins trottling PlusPlus. By the time this
happens, PlusPlus will have posed about 1,000 messages, which means with a
measly 10 messages, you can wipe an entire team's history.

** SlackBot

Slackbot is the king of all bots in slack. Not only is it a bot (and therefore
can easily be exploited), but it's got *higher permissions than any other bot*. That
means it's able to trigger bots itself (although it does not respond to bots),
as well as notify people. By exploiting slackbot, we can make our own automation
more powerful than slack lets us do directly.

Slackbot has two 'killer' features we can take advantage of, slackbot responses
and reminders. Slackbot responses are great because they're enabled by default
(meaning they're enabled almost everywhere) and you can customize them to say
whatever you want. Reminders are great because they let us effectively remove
our own infrastructure when we want to host a bot, and let slack tear itself
apart instead.

If for some reason, you find you can't access bots at all (ie: accessing slack
over the client API), you can take advantage of slackbot to solve your problems
by simply setting up a slackbot response to act like a proxy.

** SlackBot and PlusPlus

If you have both slackbot and plusplus on your slack server, you can exploit
them together for profit. Simply set up a reccuring reminder to ~@1-- @2--
@3--...~ every day or so, add plusplus, and watch the fireworks.

You don't ever need to log into slack again, people will loose their messages
for 'unexplained reasons'.

* Room For Improvement
** Threads

Threads are incredibly buggy and I guarantee you can exploit them (to hide your
messages, to cause notifications, etc), but I wasn't able to explore that in
much detail before I left slack.

** Evolution

As slack ads more misfeatures, it's likely these problems will get worse, not
better.

new slack exploit.

* Conclusion

It's incredibly easy to break slack! But why?

It boils down to a couple points, which slack could easily fix to solve all
these problems. These basic features have been requested many times, but slack
seems to be ignoring these requests.

1. Message/File Limits
2. Lack of fine grained notification control
3. Inability to block/ignore users
4. Lack of chanop (~+o~)
6. Inability of moderators to see secret channels

** Mitigation

If you are a slack moderator, and you are concerned about these threats, you should immediately:

1. Disallow user creation of all channels
2. Disallow all bots
3. Disallow deletion or editing of any messages
4. Disallow any domain from automatically joining your slack channel (manual
   invites only)
5. Disallow ~@everyone~, ~@here~, and ~@channel~.
6. Disallow setting slackbot replies, and delete any present replies
7. Ensure you *personally* know everyone in your slack team, and are able to
   hold all of them accountable.

Even with these steps, there are risks (ie: posting in a DM to slackbot cannot
be disabled, as slackbot cannot be disabled). If you would like a better
solution you can:

1. Pay slack for premium (which solves half of these issues)
2. Switch to a better designed chat platform
   - Please pick something that your team can use, not something that uses your
     team.
   - IRC (still going strong)
   - XMPP (if you really want 'modern features')
   - Matrix (if you really really want 'modern features')
